# RollingDice
Application that simulates the rolling of two dice.

This application simulates the rolling of two dice. 

The application should use an object of class Random once to roll the first die and again to roll the second die. The sum of the two values should then be calculated. Each die can show an integer value from 1 to 6, so the sum of the values
will vary from 2 to 12, with 7 being the most frequent sum, and 2 and 12 the least frequent. The application should roll the dice 36,000,000 times. Use a one-dimensional array to tally the number of times each possible sum appears. Display the results in tabular format.
